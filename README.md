Skirmish simulator for the tabletop game "Lord of the Rings Battle Strategy Game". All license rights are owned by "**Games Worshop**" trademark,

This project aims to simulates a combat following the rules stablished in the MESBG. For its implementation, there are 3 key functionalities that have been spit into 3 corresponding modules:

* ***Battle Builder Module:*** pick the participants of the fight, arrange them, pick support units...

* ***Fight Simulator Module:*** the most complex of the three. This module will allow the user to pre-select options based on the input generated from the battle builder.  Options that will be available for selection include weapons to be used, special attacks, target priority ... It is quite ambitios and the intent is to have a base from which to add complexities over time. 

* ***Fight Report:*** the intent is to simulate the same fight many times (hundreds or thousand times) to get a close as possible to the would be actual stadistical calculations.


There will be some mockups following up, let them be a small showcase of the functionalities.
